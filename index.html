						<h3> University of Ottawa (2014-2018) - GPA: 3.88 </h3>
						<i class="info">Bachelor in Computer Science</i>
						<p>
							During my second year, I was part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), in which I was supervised by Dr. Pierre Payeur. My task was to work with a robotic hand in a context of manipulation of deformable materials; I worked on automating the process of collecting essential data for use by a master's student on her thesis. To learn more about this project, <a class="smooth-scroll" href="#handRobot">click here</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my fourth and last year, I will undertake a research project with Dr. Jean-Lou de Carufel. The subject is not set in stone yet, but it will probably be related to swarm robotics.
						</p>
					</li>

						<h3> Cégep de l'Outaouais (2012-2014) - AVG: 87% </h3>
						<i class="info">College Degree in Pure Sciences</i>
						<p>
							During my two years at Cégep, I learned about many sciences which study the Universe: I studied classical mechanics, electricity, modern physics, biology and chemistry. I also acquired a strong mathematical background, going from differential equations, linear algebra, to multivariable calculus. Cégep's curriculum wasn't solely focussed on math and science - I also spent time over three semesters studying philosophy and ethics.
						</p>
						<p>
							During my last semester, I had the chance to work on a physics project with a colleague: we decided to build an autonomous robot capable of detecting a target in its surrounding, and stopping in front of it. This was my first foray into the world of robotics. To learn more about this project, <a class="smooth-scroll" href="#mobileRobot">click here</a>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3> Extracurricular </h3>
						<p>
							I like to learn outside of school. During my last year in high school, I decided to learn on my own how to build websites using <i>HTML5 & CSS3</i>. Then, in Cégep, I decided I wanted to animate these static pages I was building: I therefore learned how to program in <i>JavaScript</i> - which was my first time coding in my life - then came the back-end, using good ol' <i>PHP</i> and <i>MySQL</i>.
						</p>
						<p>
							At this point, I was getting the hang of web development. While I was working on my <a class="smooth-scroll" href="#mobileRobot">robotics project</a>, I had to learn <i>Arduino</i> (which looks pretty much like C). Due to this, I decided to learn <i>C</i> online with CS50x, an &ldquo;Introduction to Computer Science&rdquo; course given by HarvardX.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since then, I've gone to tutorials given at uOttawa on the <i>Ruby on Rails</i> framework, and I've spent lots of time working with Node.js and Go.

						I cannot think of a better way to categorize my tech/programming skills than the one <a href="http://craigbryan.github.io/#skills" target="_blank">brought by Craig Bryan</a>. The system is categorized into &ldquo;Family&rdquo;, &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; and &ldquo;Acquaintances&rdquo;, as explained below:
					</p>
						<blockquote cite="http://craigbryan.github.io/#skills">
							My "Family" — I'm in contact with these folks almost every day and I know them very well, including their quirks. <br />

							My "Friends" — I see these people pretty often, and I enjoy spending time with them. They keep some secrets from me, and that's just fine. <br />

							My "Acquaintances" — I see these people around, and only have long conversations with them occasionally. Some of them are old friends with whom I've fallen out of touch, and others are those with whom I wish I could spend more time.

							The webapp, given the student crendentials, scrapes the calendar and prompts the student to choose the colours for different classes (lectures vs labs vs discussion groups); it then adds the courses to Google Calendar.

At this time I had experience with JavaScript, but it was my first time working with this language in the back-end. We use <i>Meteor</i>, which is a framework running only on JavaScript and which makes it easy to communicate between back-end, front-end and the <i>MongoDB</i> database.
						</p>
						<p>
							So far, the experience has proven itself to be a great opportunity of collaborative work, as well as a way to familiarize myself with GitHub's structure: branches, pull requests, issues, etc.

						<i class="info">February 2014 - April 2014</i>
						<p>
							Part of my program in Cégep was to work on a science project during our last semester, which I decided to do in the physics department. With the help of a teammate, both having no background in electronics (and me having basic programming knowledge in JavaScript), we decided to build an autonomous mobile robot using an Arduino.
						</p>
						<p>
							My teammate focused more on the circuity, while I worked on the programming. The robot consisted of 2 independently controlled DC motors, an Arduino, a distance sensor, a collision sensor, a RGB LED, a dual H-Bridge, and an alimentation of 7.5V (for the Arduino) and of 12V (for the motors). The program was constantly reading data from the sensors, doing basic filtering of the data acquired and then outputting a specific voltage to the motors and triggering a specific colour of the RGB LED.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was a very inspiring experience, convincing me to go in Software Engineering. Not only that, but our project was rewarded with the best science project presentation of the day (<a href="img/mobile_robot_poster.pdf" target="_blank">here's the poster, in French only!</a>)
						</p>
						<p>
							If you're curious to learn more about the robot, the <a href="https://github.com/jonathanGB/Arduino/tree/master/Mobile_Robot" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> contains the code used, a brief presentation and also videos of the robot and of the collision sensor we used. The videos are in French, but I put up a description of them <a href="https://github.com/jonathanGB/Arduino/blob/master/Mobile_Robot/videos/video_description.MD" target="_blank">here</a>!
