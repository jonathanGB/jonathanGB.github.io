				<p class="small-12 medium-offset-1 medium-11 large-offset-0 large-12 columns">I am currently in my 2<sup>nd</sup> year, heading into my 3<sup>rd</sup> year next winter (due to credits from Cégep). I'm looking for COOP opportunities this next summer in the webdev and robotics/IoT industries.</p>

					As for now, I am VP Social & Communications at uOttawa SESA (Software Engineering Student Association). I've been part of this organization from my first year, during which I worked mainly on translating communications from English to French and communicating events organized by the organization to our fellow engineering students.

					Outside of school, I like to read about history, political sciences and technology, whether it is in physical books, newspapers, or HackerNews and Medium. I follow online courses on platforms like edX and Codecademy in order to learn new technologies and programming languages, or engineering/science subjects that interest me - for example, I'll soon achieve an <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/greatest-unsolved-mysteries-universe-anux-anu-astro1x-1" target="_blank">astronomy course on edX</a> -. 
				</p>
				<p class="small-12 medium-offset-1 medium-11 large-offset-0 large-12 columns">
					Also, I like to play hockey - I'm a defenseman -, watch soccer (German fan here) and to play the drums. My favourite bands would be Rush (you know... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auLBLk4ibAk" target="_blank">Tom Sawyer</a>? Or if you dare, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZm1_jtY1SQ" target="_blank">2112</a>... yeah, it's 20mins long, but you gotta do what you gotta do!), Nirvana (and pretty much all other grunge/alt rock of the 90s) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Z_S4DT87c" target="_blank">Jean Leloup</a> (yay, good stuff from Québec).
				</p>
				<!-- <p class="small-12 medium-offset-1 medium-11 columns">
					I also watch some shows, like &#8220;The Walking Dead&#8221; and its spinoff &#8220;Fear the Walking Dead&#8221;, &#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; and &#8220;Mr. Robot&#8221;, and game on my PC from time to time with friends.

						<h3> University of Ottawa (2014-2018) - GPA: 9.4 </h3>
						<i class="info">Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.) Software Engineering</i>
						<p>
							So far, I've studied the basis of programming, engineering and digital systems. This year will be more thorough, as I'll dig in software engineering practices, advanced concepts of C++, databases and computer architecture.
						</p>
						<p>
							If all goes according to plan, I'll be part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) this year, in which I'll be supervised by Dr. Pierre Payeur. My task will be to work with a robotic hand (<a href="http://www.barrett.com/products-hand.htm" target="_blank">BarrettHand</a>) in a context of manipulation of deformable materials; I'll be working on the software, and on the collection of essential data for a fellow Ph.D. student who will need it for his thesis. More details to come, later in the school year.
						</p>

						<h3> Cégep de l'Outaouais (2012-2014) - AVG: 87% </h3>
						<i class="info">College Degree in Pure Sciences</i>
						<p>
							During my two years here, I learned about many sciences which study the Universe: I studied classical mechanics, electricity, modern physics, biology and chemistry. I also acquired a strong mathematical background, going from differential equations, linear algebra, to multivariable calculus. Part of the Cégep's curriculum is the study of philosophy and ethics over three semesters.
						</p>
						<p>
							During my last semester, I had the chance to work on a physics project with a colleague: we decided to build an autonomous robot capable of detecting targets in its surrounding, and stopping in front of it - and that, with no priour knowledge about robotics. To learn more, about this project, <a class="smooth-scroll" href="#robot">click here</a>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3> Extracurricular </h3>
						<p>
							Even though I think standard education is important, I like to learn outside of school. In my last year in high school (before going to Cégep), I decided to learn by myself how to build websites, using <i>HTML5 & CSS3</i>. Then, in Cégep, I decided I wanted to animate these static pages I was building: I therefore learned how to program in <i>JavaScript</i> - which was my first time coding in my life -; then came the back-end, using good ol' <i>PHP</i> and <i>MySQL</i>.
						</p>
						<p>
							At this point, I was getting the hang of web development. While I was working on my <a class="smooth-scroll" href="#robot">robotics project</a>, I had to learn <i>Arduino</i> (which looks pretty much like <i>C</i>). Due to this, I decided to learn <i>C</i> online with CS50x, an &ldquo;Introduction to Computer Science&rdquo; course given by HarvardX.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since then, I've went to tutorials given at uOttawa on the <i>Ruby on Rails</i> framework, and during the last summer I dove into <i>Node.js</i> and <i>Meteor</i>, which uses <i>MongoDB</i>, a <i>NoSQL</i> database service.

						I cannot think of a better way to categorize my tech/programming skills than the one <a href="http://www.craigbryan.me/#skills" target="_blank">brought by Craig Bryan</a>, a fellow exec at SESA. The system is categorized into &ldquo;Family&rdquo;, &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; and &ldquo;Acquaintances&rdquo;, as explained below:
					</p>
						<blockquote cite="http://www.craigbryan.me/#skills">
							My "Family" — I'm in contact with these folks almost every day and I know them very well, including their quirks. <br />

							My "Friends" — I see these people pretty often, and I enjoy spending time with them. They keep some secrets from me, and that's just fine. <br />

							My "Acquaintances" — I see these people around, and only have long conversations with them occasionally. Some of them are old friends with whom I've fallen out of touch, and others are those with whom I wish I could spend more time.
